//////////////////////////////////
CS 615 Deep Learning Final Project
//////////////////////////////////

The files DL.py and DL_gnn.py are required to run the code.
main_gnn.py contains the final code for the project.

main.py can be ignored but it does show an earlier attempt at the problem and shows a working version of pong created using pygame
	that could be used in place of openAI gym.

Running main_gnn.py will train a population size of 20 for 40 generations using openAI gym and at the end, display the best AI playing the game.


/////////////////////////////////
This program requires openAI gym and the atari package along with the rom for the atari version of pong.
These can be obtain using pip and may require a bit of extra work to make the roms usable by openAI gym.

This program was created and tested on Python 3.9.0 64-bit.
